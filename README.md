## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The codebase is written in its entirety in [Python3.8.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Requirements.txt contains all the necessary packages to successfully run the code. To These are easily installed with the following instuction:

```

```

Deze codebase is volledig geschreven in [Python3.6.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In requirements.txt staan alle benodigde packages om de code succesvol te draaien. Deze zijn gemakkelijk te installeren via pip dmv. de volgende instructie:

### Structure

All the Python scripts are located in the "code" folder. The "data" map contains all the input values. The results are stored in "results" folder.
